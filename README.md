# Easy Hotspot
Front end to manage Mikrotik Routers using the RouterOS PHP API 

Code is still a work-in-progress. Documentation will follow later.

To try out the application:
1. Install LAMPP or XAMPP with MySQL
2. Enter MySQL credentials in <ProjectDirectory>/model/db_conn.php
3. Start Apache server
4. Access login.php from any browser
5. Give any username and password and click login
6. It'll say user doesn't exist, but the database and tables are created now.
7. Now login with username "admin" and password "admin"

I haven't been acively developing this project. If you think it's still worth it, please let me know. I will find more time to contribute.

Thank you.
